**Advancing White Blood Cell Classification: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach with GAN-Based Data Balancing**  

This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper titled **"Advancing WBC Classification: A Hybrid ConvNextV2-Swin Transformer Framework with R3GAN Data Balancing and CLAHE Preprocessing"**, which introduces a novel methodology for highly accurate classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in imbalanced medical imaging datasets.  

### üîë **Key Features**  
1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Leverages the strengths of **ConvNextV2** (a modern CNN variant) and **Swin Transformer** (a hierarchical vision transformer) to capture both local and global features in blood cell images, achieving robust feature representation.  
2. **Data Balancing with GANs**: Addresses class imbalance in the Raabin-WBC dataset using advanced generative models:  
   - **R3-GAN** (Recurrent Residual Refinement GAN) and **ECC-GAN** (Edge-Aware Cycle-Consistent GAN) to synthesize high-fidelity, diverse WBC images.  
3. **CLAHE Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality via **Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**, improving model sensitivity to subtle cellular structures.  
4. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves **~99% accuracy** in WBC classification, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods.  

### üìù **Methodology Overview**  
- **Data Augmentation**: R3-GAN and ECC-GAN generate realistic synthetic images to balance underrepresented WBC classes in the Raabin dataset.  
- **CLAHE**: Preprocesses raw images to enhance contrast and highlight critical morphological details.  
- **ConvNextV2-Swin Fusion**: Combines ConvNextV2‚Äôs spatial feature extraction with Swin Transformer‚Äôs long-range dependency modeling, optimized through cross-stage feature fusion.  

### üìà **Results**  
The proposed framework outperforms existing approaches in precision, recall, and F1-score, validated on the challenging Raabin-WBC dataset. The hybrid model‚Äôs interpretability is further enhanced via attention maps from the Swin Transformer.
